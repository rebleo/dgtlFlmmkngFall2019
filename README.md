Through a variety of in class and homework assignments, this course introduces participants to a variety of video making techniques, vocabulary and tools while learning the basics of concept development, video capture and editing with Adobe Premiere. Students will learn the fundamentals of recording and editing, lighting, sound, camera work and other pre and post production methods.

#### Class Requirements:
This is a studio lab. You are expected to be present, participate in a positive and constructive manner, and produce thoughtful and creative work. It is not possible to pass this course on your own. In order to do well and succeed in this course, it is necessary to participate in all classroom activities and discussions.

Missing class is missing your opportunity and ability to succeed. No filmmaker works in a vacuum and part of this class is devoted to honing your communication and collaboration skills. Critique is a major part of the class and attendance is necessary in order to participate. Students who are chronically late or absent will miss a significant portion of the content and required exercises/quizzes of the class.

Two unexcused absences will result in a drop of grade (for example from an A to a B, from a B to a C). Four unexcused absences will result in automatic F. Late arrival or early departure (15 minutes or more) is the equivalent of half of an absence.


It is your responsibility to turn in work on time, to make up any missed assignments, and to catch up with the class in the event of an absence. Late work is unacceptable; however, this work can be turned in for partial credit. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance. You should have this page and the [wiki](https://github.com/rebleo/dgtlFlmmkngFall2019/wiki) bookmarked + check them regularly.

#### Assignments:
Every week students will be asked to read, watch and reflect on through blog posts and in-class discussions - a variety of media as well as share the work they create during in class discussion and critique.
